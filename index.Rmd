**The major research focus of our lab is to construct a system, called "*EHRtoPKPD*", for drug-related studies such as pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and pharmacogenomics (PGx) studies using electronic health records (EHRs). This system would allow to perform drug-related studie more efficiently by standardizing data extraction, data processing, and data building procedures. This system would provide a foundation for PK/PD-model guided clinical decision support systems embedded in EHRs to provide an optimal pharmacotherapy, the overarching goal of precision medicine.**

*EHRtoPKPD* is a modular system, divided into the three major procedures: data extraction ("*Extract-*"), data processing ("*Pro-*"),  and data building ("*Build-*"). Modules were created or under development (gray color box) depending on the data element, task to perform, and type of PK/PD models. 

For drugs with complex prescription pattern, dose data obtained from e-prescription databases may not be accurate enough to perform PK/PD studies. For these drugs, we may need to extract drug dose information from clinical notes using a natural language processing (NLP) system. We developed a flexible and targeted NLP system that can directly extract drug dose information from clinical notes, which was incorporated into our system ([*Extract-Med*](Extract-Med.html)). 

Building drug dose data from extracted dose information can be challenging. To address these challenges, we developed a dose data building algorithm that was implemented in our system ([*Pro-Med-NLP*](Pro-Med-NLP.html)). 

For drugs with simple prescription pattern, dose data can be relatively easily extracted from e-prescription databases and processed using [*Pro-Med-Str*](Pro-Med-Str-Part2.html) module. 

Other data elements such as drug levels ([*Pro-Drug Level*](Build-PK-IV-comprehensive.html)), demographics ([*Pro-Demographic*](Build-PK-IV-comprehensive.html)), and laboratory data ([*Pro-Laboratory*](Build-PK-IV-comprehensive.html)) can be processed using our system. These data can be combined with processed dose data to build PK/PD data using PK/PD data building modules (i.e., [*Build-PK-IV*](Build-PK-IV-simple.html), [*Build-PK-Oral*](Build-PK-Oral.html)). 

The NLP system is available as an R package, *medExtractR*, and the functions to run each module are implemented as an R package, *EHR*. More details can be found in Choi *et al.*$^{1}$, and additional modules will be added in the future as it evolves.
