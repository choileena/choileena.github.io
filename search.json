This system would allow to perform the studies more efficiently by standardizing data extraction, data processing, and data building procedures. This system would provide the foundation for PK/PD-model guided clinical decision support systems embedded in EHRs to provide an optimal pharmacotherapy, the overarching goal of precision medicine.\n\nThe EHRtoPKPD, a System for PK/PD Studies using EHRs.\nModified from Clin Pharm Ther 2020.\nEHRtoPKPD is a modular system, divided into the three major procedures: data extraction (“Extract-”), data processing (“Pro-”), and data building (“Build-”). Modules were created or under development (gray color box) depending on the data element, task to perform, and type of PK/PD models. For drugs with simple prescription pattern, dose data can be relatively easily extracted from e-prescription databases and processed using Pro-Med-Str module. However, we found that dosing data obtained from e-prescription databases often are not accurate enough for PK/PD studies. Thus, we developed more flexible and targeted NLP system that performed better than existing state-of-art NLP systems for drug dose extraction. Our NLP system was incorporated into our system (Extract-Med module), which can directly extract drug dose information from clinical notes, which is also available as an R package, medExtractR. As building drug dose data from extracted dose information can be very challenging, we developed a dose data building algorithm which was also implemented in our system (Pro-Med-NLP). Other data elements such as drug levels (Pro-Drug Level), demographics (Pro-Demographic), and laboratory data (Pro-Laboratory) can be processed using our system, and then combined with processed dose data to build PK/PD data using PK/PD data building modules (i.e., Build-PK-IV, Build-PK-Oral). The functions to run each module is implemented as R packages, medExtractR and EHR. The EHRtoPKPD will evolve as more modules are added.\n\nLab Team\nCole Beck\nElizabeth McNeer\nMichael Williams\nNathan James\nAlumni\nHannah Weeks\n\n\n\n",
