Here add links to vignettes

# [*Extract-Med*](Extract-Med.html)
This lecture describes how to obtain drug dosing information from unstructured clinical notes using *Extract-Med* module in the system.

# [*Pro-Med-NLP*](Pro-Med-NLP.html)
This lecture describes how to build longitudinal medication dose data from the raw output of an NLP system using the *Pro-Med-NLP* module.

# [*Build-PK-Oral*](Build-PK-Oral.html)
This lecture describes the PK data building procedure in the *EHRtoPKPD* for medications that are typically orally administrated. It demonstrates how to quickly build PK data using *Build-PK-Oral* when drug dose data that can be provided by users or generated from unstructured clinical notes using extracted dosing information with the *Extract-Med* module and processed with the *Pro-Med-NLP* module in the system.

# [*Build-PK-IV* - Simple](Build-PK-IV-simple.html)
This lecture describes a simple PK data building procedure in the *EHRtoPKPD* for medications that are typically intravenously administrated. It demonstrates how to quickly build PK data using *Build-PK-IV* without using the data processing modules when cleaned data for concentration, drug dose, demographic and laboratory datasets are already available in an appropriate data form.

# [*Build-PK-IV* - Comprehensive](Build-PK-IV-comprehensive.html)
This lecture describes a comprehensive PK data building procedure in the *EHRtoPKPD* for medications that are typically intravenously administrated. It demonstrates how to utilize several data processing modules (e.g., *Pro-Demographic*, *Pro-Med-Str*, *Pro-Drug Level*, *Pro-Laboratory*) to standardize and combine more complex datasets when cleaned data are not available, and then finally build PK data using *Build-PK-IV*.

# [*Pro-Med-Str* - Part II](Pro-Med-Str-Part2.html)
This lecture describes how to processes structured medication data, especially focusing on e-prescription data.

# *Pro-Med-Str* - Part I
This lecture describes how to processes structured medication data, especially focusing on intravenously given dose data.
